**codeIndore( )** is the student technical community by students and for the students in Indore, India.

There exists a huge gap between the classroom and the tech industry. There is also a rift between being a beginner programmer and a professional developer and a similar divide exists between being able to create elegant solutions and relying on pre-existing methods. <br />At codeIndore(), we aim to merge these clefts and bridge the gaps.

We are a community of students that provides an environment of learning, networking,  enjoying, and progressing together. Join us in our upcoming [events](/events/) and be a part of our community.

You are welcome to any of our regular meetups, workshops, conferences, hackathons, or informal gatherings for loads of learning and fun. You can connect with us on any one of your preferred platforms [here](/connect/).
