**codeIndore( )** is the student technical community by students and for the students in Indore, India.
<br /><br />
There exists a huge gap between the classroom and the tech industry. There is also a rift between being a beginner programmer and a professional developer and a similar divide exists between being able to create elegant solutions and relying on pre-existing methods. <br />At codeIndore(), we aim to merge these clefts and bridge the gaps.
<br /><br />
We are a community of students that provides an environment of learning, networking,  enjoying, and progressing together. Join us in our upcoming [events](/events/) and be a part of our community.
<br /> <br />
You are welcome to any of our regular meetups, workshops, conferences, hackathons, or informal gatherings for loads of learning and fun. You can [connect with us](/connect/) on any one of your preferred platforms [here](/connect/).
